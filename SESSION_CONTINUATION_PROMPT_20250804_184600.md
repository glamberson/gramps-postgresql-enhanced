# Comprehensive Session Continuation Prompt

## Context
I need to continue development of the Gramps PostgreSQL Enhanced addon. I was working on implementing flexible database connection configuration and testing person creation in Gramps.

## Current State
The PostgreSQL Enhanced addon for Gramps genealogy software has just had major architectural improvements implemented:

1. **Connection Configuration**: Added connection_info.txt file support that's automatically created from a template when users create a new family tree.

2. **Database Modes**: 
   - **Separate mode**: Each family tree gets its own PostgreSQL database (requires CREATEDB privilege)
   - **Shared mode**: All trees in one database with table prefixes (works without CREATEDB)

3. **GENERATED Columns**: Using PostgreSQL 12+ GENERATED STORED columns instead of triggers for automatic field population from JSONB.

4. **JSONB Serialization Fix**: Added wrapper to convert psycopg3's dict/list returns back to strings for Gramps' JSONSerializer.

## Key Technical Details
- Using psycopg3 (NOT psycopg2)
- PostgreSQL 15+ with template_gramps containing extensions
- Gramps 6.0.1 on Debian
- Plugin location: ~/.local/share/gramps/gramps60/plugins/PostgreSQLEnhanced/
- Repository: https://github.com/glamberson/gramps-postgresql-enhanced

## Known Issues
1. DBAPI tries to UPDATE GENERATED columns (handled by ignoring specific errors)
2. name_group table must have columns 'name' and 'grouping' (not 'key' and 'value')
3. Must use JSONSerializer not BlobSerializer

## Critical Files
Please read these handover documents in order:
1. `HANDOVER_2025_01_20_EVENING.md` - Latest session summary
2. `COMPREHENSIVE_HANDOVER_2025_08_04_EVENING.md` - Previous major session
3. `ARCHITECTURE_LEARNINGS_2025_08_04.md` - Deep architectural insights
4. `CONNECTION_CONFIG_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Connection system details

## Testing Process
The user's testing workflow is:
1. Delete all previous databases
2. Go into plugin manager and refresh
3. Load PostgreSQL Enhanced plugin
4. Create a new database
5. Try to add one person

We haven't successfully created a person yet due to various errors we've been fixing.

## Current Task
Test the addon with the new connection configuration system:
1. Start Gramps with `/usr/bin/gramps`
2. Create a new family tree
3. Verify connection_info.txt is created
4. Check if database is created automatically
5. Try to add a person
6. Fix any errors that occur

## Important Notes
- DO NOT manipulate the database directly with psql during testing
- Let the addon handle all database operations
- The user has genealogy_user with CREATEDB privileges on 192.168.10.90
- The addon should now extract database names from Gramps paths correctly

Please continue from where we left off, focusing on testing person creation with the new configuration system.
