# PostgreSQL Enhanced Connection Configuration
# This file is automatically created when you create a new family tree.
# Edit the values below to match your PostgreSQL setup.

# Connection details
host = 192.168.10.90
port = 5432
user = genealogy_user
password = GenealogyData2025

# Database mode: 'separate' or 'shared'
# separate = Each family tree gets its own PostgreSQL database (recommended)
#            Requires user to have CREATEDB privilege
# shared = All family trees in one database with table prefixes
#          Use this if your database user lacks CREATEDB privilege
database_mode = separate

# For shared mode only: the name of the shared database
# (ignored in separate mode)
shared_database_name = gramps_shared

# Optional advanced settings
# pool_size = 10              # Connection pool size
# sslmode = prefer            # SSL connection mode (disable, allow, prefer, require)
# connect_timeout = 10        # Connection timeout in seconds

# Note: After editing this file, close and reopen the family tree in Gramps
# for the changes to take effect.
