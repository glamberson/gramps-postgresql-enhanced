# Gramps Coding Standards Compliance Status

## Date: 2025-08-05

### Completed Tasks

1. **Sphinx Docstrings** ✅
   - Added comprehensive Sphinx-style docstrings to all public methods in postgresqlenhanced.py
   - Included proper :param:, :type:, :returns:, :rtype:, and :raises: tags
   - Documented all wrapper classes (TablePrefixWrapper, CursorPrefixWrapper)

2. **Code Formatting** ✅
   - Applied Black formatter to all Python files in the project
   - Ensured consistent formatting across the codebase
   - Fixed trailing whitespace issues

3. **Pylint Improvements** ✅
   - Fixed critical issues:
     - Removed f-string formatting in logging functions (using % formatting instead)
     - Fixed bare except clause (now catches specific exceptions)
     - Added 'from e' to exception re-raising
     - Removed unused imports
   - Addressed many pylint warnings

4. **Import Organization** ✅
   - Reorganized imports to follow PEP8 standards
   - Removed duplicate imports
   - Commented out currently unused imports

### Remaining Tasks

1. **Additional Docstrings**
   - connection.py needs Sphinx docstrings
   - schema.py needs Sphinx docstrings
   - Other module files need documentation

2. **Pylint Score**
   - Current score is affected by unavoidable issues:
     - Import errors (Gramps modules not in environment)
     - Too many instance attributes (inherited from DBAPI)
     - Line length in some complex queries
   - Target: 9+ score with reasonable exclusions

3. **Callback Naming**
   - Review code for any callback methods
   - Ensure they follow cb_* naming convention

4. **Testing**
   - Create automated test suite
   - Ensure all tests pass consistently

### Code Quality Metrics

- **Docstring Coverage**: postgresqlenhanced.py fully documented
- **Black Formatting**: All files formatted
- **Critical Pylint Issues**: Fixed
- **NO FALLBACK Policy**: Fully maintained

### Next Steps

1. Add docstrings to remaining modules (connection.py, schema.py)
2. Create automated test runner
3. Update plugin in Gramps directory
4. Consider refactoring to reduce complexity metrics
