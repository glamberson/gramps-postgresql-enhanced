# PostgreSQL Enhanced Addon - Current Status Report

## Date: 2025-08-06 17:00 EEST

## Testing Progress

### ‚úÖ Successful Operations
1. **Database Creation**: Multiple trees created successfully
2. **GEDCOM Import**: Successfully imported test GEDCOM files
3. **Basic Operations**: All CRUD operations working
4. **Table Prefixing**: Monolithic mode with prefixes working correctly
5. **Reference Rebuilding**: Successfully processed 441,342+ references before encountering Gramps bug

### üîß Fixed Issues (Today)
1. **F-string SQL interpolation** (schema.py) - 19 instances fixed
2. **Lambda function runtime variables** (postgresqlenhanced.py) - 4 instances fixed  
3. **Mixed SQL parameter formatting** (postgresqlenhanced.py) - 2 instances fixed
4. **UPDATE query generation** (postgresqlenhanced.py) - 2 instances fixed

All were caused by overzealous linting that converted f-strings to % formatting without understanding runtime vs definition-time evaluation.

### üêõ Known Issues

#### PostgreSQL Addon Issues
- None currently identified in the addon itself

#### Gramps Issues
1. **Check Tool Bug**: Crashes on None family references (documented in GRAMPS_CHECK_TOOL_BUG.md)
2. **GEDCOM Parser**: Drops Ancestry.com proprietary fields (expected, not critical)

### üìä Performance Observations
- Import speed: ~13 persons/second for large GEDCOM
- Memory usage: Reasonable (peak 473MB for 86k person import)
- Database operations: Efficient with proper indexing
- Reference rebuilding: Handled 441k+ operations without issue

## Code Quality

### Linting Status
- **Partially linted**: Attempted full linting broke the code
- **F-strings required**: Many places need runtime interpolation
- **Mixed formatting**: SQL parameters and Python variables need different handling

### Documentation
- ‚úÖ Linting errors documented
- ‚úÖ Gramps bug documented  
- ‚úÖ Session handover documents maintained
- ‚úÖ Debug guides created

## Testing TODO

### Immediate
- [ ] Test separate database mode (not just monolithic)
- [ ] Test with multiple concurrent users
- [ ] Test backup/restore operations
- [ ] Test upgrade scenarios

### Stress Testing
- [ ] Import multiple large GEDCOMs sequentially
- [ ] Test with 38 million person target
- [ ] Memory leak testing over extended operations
- [ ] Transaction rollback scenarios

### Integration Testing  
- [ ] All Gramps views and reports
- [ ] All Gramps tools (except known broken Check tool)
- [ ] Export operations (GEDCOM, XML, etc.)
- [ ] Plugin compatibility

## Current State Summary

The PostgreSQL Enhanced addon is **functionally working** but **not production-ready** until:

1. Complete testing of all modes (especially separate database mode)
2. Stress testing at scale is completed
3. All integration points are verified
4. Documentation is finalized
5. Submission package is prepared

## Next Steps

1. Continue systematic testing
2. Fix any issues discovered
3. Complete documentation
4. Prepare for Gramps project submission
5. Consider workarounds for Gramps bugs if needed

## Important Notes

- **DO NOT declare production-ready** until all testing complete
- **DO NOT rush testing** - accuracy is critical for genealogy data
- **DO maintain debug logs** for all testing sessions
- **DO document all issues** found during testing
