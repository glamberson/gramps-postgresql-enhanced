95,000 people means approximately:
- 95,000 person records
- ~40,000-50,000 families (assuming ~2.3 people per family average)
- ~300,000-500,000 events (3-5 events per person average)
- ~100,000+ citations
- ~50,000+ places
- Millions of relationship links

At ~400-500 bytes per person in GEDCOM format, that's about right for 40MB.

With full debug logging, expect:
- Log file: 5-10 GB
- Import time: 30-60 minutes
- PostgreSQL will handle this much better than SQLite would
