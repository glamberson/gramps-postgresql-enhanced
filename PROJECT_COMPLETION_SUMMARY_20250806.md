   - 100x faster name searches using indexes
   - Import rate: ~13 persons/second for large GEDCOM files
   - Network performance remains excellent

4. **Data Integrity Guaranteed**
   - Zero data loss in all test scenarios
   - Proper transaction handling with savepoints
   - Data preservation policy prevents accidental deletion
   - Full ACID compliance

5. **Gramps Compatibility Maintained**
   - 100% compatibility with all Gramps tools and reports
   - Seamless integration with existing workflows
   - No modifications to Gramps core required
