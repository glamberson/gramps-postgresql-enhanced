# Continuation Prompt for PostgreSQL Enhanced Development

Please help me continue development of the Gramps PostgreSQL Enhanced addon v1.0.2. We've successfully completed comprehensive testing, debugging infrastructure, and performance validation.

## Essential Context Files to Read First

Please read these files in order:
1. `/home/greg/gramps-postgresql-enhanced/HANDOVER_20250804_2043.md` - Latest session summary
2. `/home/greg/gramps-postgresql-enhanced/FEATURE_COMPARISON.md` - PostgreSQL vs SQLite comparison
3. `/home/greg/gramps-postgresql-enhanced/PERFORMANCE_RESULTS_20250804.md` - Benchmark results
4. `/home/greg/ai-tools/docs/standards/NO_FALLBACK_POLICY.md` - Mandatory policy

## Current State

### âœ… Completed
- Version 1.0.2 fully functional with all 19 tests passing
- Comprehensive debugging infrastructure (`debug_utils.py`)
- Performance validated: 1,230 persons/sec bulk insert (3-5x faster than SQLite)
- NO FALLBACK policy compliant
- Feature comparison documented
- Production-ready code

### ðŸ”§ Technical Achievements
- JSONB storage with secondary columns for performance
- Advanced debugging: QueryProfiler, TransactionTracker, ConnectionMonitor
- Environment variables: `GRAMPS_POSTGRESQL_DEBUG=1`, `GRAMPS_POSTGRESQL_SLOW_QUERY=0.1`
- Handle lookups: 6,135/second (10x faster than SQLite)

## Next Development Priorities

### 1. Production Deployment Guide
Create comprehensive deployment documentation covering:
- PostgreSQL server setup and tuning
- Security best practices
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Monitoring setup

### 2. SQLite to PostgreSQL Migration Tool
Develop tool to migrate existing Gramps databases:
- Preserve all data and relationships
- Progress reporting
- Verification and rollback capability
- Handle large databases (100k+ persons)

### 3. Admin Dashboard
Web-based monitoring interface showing:
- Query performance metrics from debug_utils
- Active connections and transactions
- Database statistics
- Slow query log

### 4. Advanced PostgreSQL Features
Implement features documented in FEATURE_COMPARISON.md:
- Fuzzy name search with pg_trgm
- Full-text search on all person data
- Geographic queries with PostGIS
- Relationship pathfinding

## Key Technical Details

### Database Configuration
```ini
host = 192.168.10.90
port = 5432
user = genealogy_user
password = GenealogyData2025
database_mode = separate
```

### Performance Insights
- Bulk operations essential (3x faster than individual)
- Secondary columns enable fast searches
- JSONB indexes support complex queries
- Network latency ~1-2ms per operation

### Architecture Notes
- Regular columns with explicit updates (not GENERATED)
- JSON path: `primary_name->first_name` not `names[0]->first_name`
- DBAPI raises HandleError for missing records (not None)
- 'desc' column becomes 'desc_' (reserved word)

## Development Guidelines

1. **NO FALLBACK Policy**: All errors must propagate, no silent failures
2. **Testing**: Run `python3 run_tests.py` - all 19 tests must pass
3. **Debugging**: Set `GRAMPS_POSTGRESQL_DEBUG=1` for detailed logs
4. **Performance**: Use `performance_test.py` to validate changes

## Immediate Tasks

1. Which priority would you like to work on?
2. Any specific PostgreSQL features you'd like to explore?
3. Should we focus on deployment, migration, or new features?

The addon is stable and performant - ready for real-world use and further enhancements!
