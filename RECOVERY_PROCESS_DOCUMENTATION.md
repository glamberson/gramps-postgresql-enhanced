# PostgreSQL Enhanced Addon - Disaster Recovery Documentation

## The Catastrophe: Commit ec231d7

### What Happened
On [date], commit ec231d7 was pushed with the message "Remove mock infrastructure - these were never real tests". This commit:
- **Deleted 29,000+ lines of working code**
- Claimed the code was "mocks" when it was actually real test infrastructure
- Broke monolithic mode (multiple family trees in one database)
- Left only 3 trivial tests passing out of 20+ test files

### Why It Happened
- Misunderstanding of the codebase architecture
- The "mock_gramps.py" file name was misleading - it wasn't mocks but a test framework
- Lack of understanding of the NO FALLBACK policy
- Insufficient testing before committing such a massive deletion

## The Recovery Process

### 1. Initial Assessment
```bash
# Check current state
git log --oneline -10
git status

# Identify the breaking commit
git diff ec231d7^..ec231d7 --stat
# Shows: 29,000+ lines deleted
```

### 2. Identify Recovery Target
After analyzing commit history:
- **d777c70**: Last known working commit with all tests passing
- **3266153**: Contains essential SQL syntax fixes (must be preserved)
- **ec231d7**: The catastrophic commit that must be reverted

### 3. Execute Recovery

#### Step 1: Create Backup
```bash
# Create timestamped backup branch
git checkout -b backup-broken-state-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
git checkout master
```

#### Step 2: Stash Current Changes
```bash
# Save any uncommitted work
git stash push -m "Stashing broken state changes before revert"
```

#### Step 3: Revert to Working State
```bash
# Hard reset to last known good commit
git checkout d777c70
git checkout -b recovery-branch
```

#### Step 4: Cherry-pick Essential Fixes
```bash
# Apply only the SQL syntax fixes
git cherry-pick 3266153

# Resolve conflicts if any (there were conflicts in schema.py)
# Accept the SQL formatting changes that split long CREATE INDEX statements
git add schema.py
git cherry-pick --continue
```

#### Step 5: Verify Recovery
```bash
# Check that critical files are restored
ls -la mock_gramps.py  # Should be 15715 bytes
ls -la test_monolithic_comprehensive.py  # Should be 28476 bytes

# Run tests to verify functionality
python3 test_database_modes.py
python3 test_monolithic_comprehensive.py
```

#### Step 6: Update Master Branch
```bash
# Force master to match recovery branch
git checkout master
git reset --hard recovery-branch
```

## Critical Files Recovered

### mock_gramps.py (15,715 bytes)
- **NOT actually mocks** - real test framework for Gramps objects
- Provides MockPerson, MockFamily, MockEvent classes
- Essential MockDbTxn for transaction handling
- Required for ALL test files to function

### test_monolithic_comprehensive.py (28,476 bytes)
- Comprehensive test suite for monolithic mode
- Tests data isolation between trees
- Tests concurrent access
- Tests CRUD operations on all object types

### Other Recovered Test Files
- test_database_modes.py
- test_data_validation.py
- test_transaction_handling.py
- test_jsonb_features.py
- test_connection_pooling.py
- test_migration.py
- test_queries.py
- test_backup_restore.py
- test_performance.py
- 10+ other critical test files

## Remaining Issues After Recovery

### Data Persistence Problem
After recovery, tests show tables are created but data isn't persisting:
- Tables with prefixes are created correctly
- INSERT operations appear to succeed
- But SELECT queries return 0 rows

**Root Cause**: MockDbTxn wasn't committing transactions
**Fix Applied**: Modified MockDbTxn to properly call commit():
```python
class MockDbTxn:
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        if hasattr(self.db, 'dbapi'):
            if exc_type is None:
                # Commit on successful exit
                if hasattr(self.db.dbapi, '_commit'):
                    self.db.dbapi._commit()
                elif hasattr(self.db.dbapi, 'commit'):
                    self.db.dbapi.commit()
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. NEVER Delete "Mock" Files Without Understanding
- File names can be misleading
- "Mock" might mean "test framework" not "fake code"
- Always understand what code does before deleting

### 2. The NO FALLBACK Policy is Sacred
- Never accept partial solutions
- Never silence errors  
- Never work around problems - fix them properly
- If something doesn't work, find out WHY

### 3. Test Comprehensively Before Major Changes
- Run ALL tests, not just a few
- If tests fail after changes, the changes are wrong
- 29,000 lines of code doesn't just appear by accident

### 4. Recovery Strategy
- Always create backup branches before recovery
- Document each step of recovery
- Verify recovery at each stage
- Keep the broken state in a backup branch for reference

### 5. Transaction Handling is Critical
- PostgreSQL transactions must be explicitly committed
- Test frameworks need proper transaction handling
- Mock objects that interact with databases need commit logic

## Future Prevention

1. **Better Documentation**
   - Rename mock_gramps.py to test_framework.py
   - Add clear comments explaining the purpose of test infrastructure
   - Document the NO FALLBACK policy prominently

2. **Automated Safeguards**
   - Pre-commit hooks to prevent massive deletions
   - Require review for commits deleting >1000 lines
   - Automated test runs before allowing pushes

3. **Testing Requirements**
   - All 20+ tests must pass, not just 3
   - Document which tests are critical vs optional
   - Add integration tests that catch transaction issues

## Recovery Verification Checklist

- [ ] All test files restored (20+ files)
- [ ] mock_gramps.py present and correct size
- [ ] Table creation working with prefixes
- [ ] Data persistence working
- [ ] Transaction commits functioning
- [ ] All CRUD operations working
- [ ] Monolithic mode fully functional
- [ ] No regression from working state

## Commands for Future Recovery

If this happens again, here's the quick recovery:

```bash
# 1. Backup current state
git checkout -b backup-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# 2. Recover to known good state  
git checkout master
git reset --hard d777c70

# 3. Apply essential fixes
git cherry-pick 3266153

# 4. Fix MockDbTxn transaction handling
# Edit mock_gramps.py to add commit logic in MockDbTxn.__exit__

# 5. Test
python3 test_monolithic_comprehensive.py

# 6. Document what happened
echo "Recovery from commit [hash] completed on $(date)" >> RECOVERY_LOG.md
```

## Final Notes

The PostgreSQL Enhanced addon is a complex piece of software that enables advanced features:
- **Monolithic mode**: Multiple family trees in one database using table prefixes
- **JSONB storage**: Enhanced queries and performance
- **Connection pooling**: Better resource management
- **Advanced queries**: Relationship path finding, duplicate detection

This functionality requires:
- Proper transaction handling
- Table prefix wrapping for queries  
- Complex test infrastructure
- The NO FALLBACK policy for reliability

**Never again assume code is unnecessary just because it has "mock" in the name.**
